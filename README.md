# CPA - Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder

`CPA` is a collaborative research project from
Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and a computatiobal biology group of Prof. Fabian 
Theis (https://github.com/theislab) from Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen. 

## What is CPA?
![Screenshot](Figure1.png)

`CPA` is a framework to learn effects of perturbations at the single-cell level. CPA encodes and learns phenotypic drug response across different cell types, doses and drug combinations. CPA allows:

* Out-of-distribution predicitons of unseen drug combinations at various doses and among different cell types.
* Learn interpretable drug and cell type latent spaces.
* Estimate dose response curve for each perturbation and their combinations.
* Access the uncertainty of the estimations of the model.

## Package Structure

The repository is centered around the `cpa` module:

* [`cpa.train`](cpa/train.py) contains scripts to train the model.
* [`cpa.api`](cpa/api.py) contains user friendly scripts to interact with the model via scanpy.
* [`cpa.plotting`](cpa/plotting.py) contains scripts to plotting functions.
* [`cpa.model`](cpa/model.py) contains modules of cpa model.
* [`cpa.data`](cpa/data.py) contains data loader, which transforms anndata structure to a class compatible with cpa model.

Additional files and folders:

* [`datasets`](datasets/) contains both versions of the data: raw and pre-processed.
* [`preprocessing`](preprocessing/) contains notebooks to reproduce the datasets pre-processing from raw data.

## Usage

- As a first step, download the contents of `datasets/` and `pretrained_models/` from [this tarball](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dlp/cpa_binaries.tar).


To learn how to use this repository, check 
[`./notebooks/demo.ipynb`](notebooks/demo.ipynb), and the following scripts:


* Note that hyperparameters in the `demo.ipynb` are set as default but might not work work for new datasets.
## Examples and Reproducibility
All the examples and the reproducbility notebooks for the plots in the paper could be found in the [`reproducibility`](https://github.com/theislab/cpa-reproducibility) repo.

## Curation of your own data to train CPA

* To prepare your data to train CPA, you need to add specific fields to adata object and perfrom data split. Examples on how to add 
necessary fields for multiple datasets used in the paper can be found in [`preprocessing/`](/https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPA/tree/master/preprocessing) folder.

## Training a model

There are two ways to train a cpa model:

* Using the command line, e.g.: `python -m cpa.train --data datasets/GSM_new.h5ad  --save_dir /tmp --max_epochs 1 --doser_type sigm`
* From jupyter notebook: example in [`./notebooks/demo.ipynb`](notebooks/demo.ipynb)


## Documentation

Currently you can access the documentation via `help` function in IPython. For example:

```python
from cpa.api import API

help(API)

from cpa.plotting import CPAVisuals

help(CPAVisuals)

```

A separate page with the documentation is coming soon.
